This project uses C programming language to develop an interface for the
ATmega328/P microcontroller (Arduino Uno) to communicate with the 
DS1302 Real-time Clock (RTC) module.

Functions:
+ Setting initial hour-minute-second and write to the RTC module
+ Retrieve current hour-minute-second stored on the RTC module
+ Time is update continuously and display on 7-segment LEDs

* DS1302_Interface.c is deployable and re-runable on the 
  ATmega328/P microcontroller (Arduino Uno)

* Check DS1302.pdf for the RTC datasheet
